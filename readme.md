# Interview task/assignment: speed up a simple path tracer

This project contains a simple triangle mesh path tracer implemented in C++.
It's a command line application that takes screen size & input .OBJ data file parameters,
renders it using "path tracing" algorithm and produces `output.png` result file.

Here are some images that the program can produce with the data files present under `data/` directory:

![result1](/result3Suzanne.png?raw=true "Suzanne")
![result2](/result5Sponza.png?raw=true "Sponza")

## The Task

Current program is slow. *Really slow*. Rendering that monkey head model ("Suzanne") at a lowly 640x360 resolution,
4 samples per pixel, takes **one minute** on my PC! Rendering the other image ("Sponza") at the same resolution takes **five hours**.

Your task then is, of course, to make the program faster :)

I know for sure that it is possible to make it faster by *more than a hundred times* -- e.g. I got Suzanne from a minute down
to 0.2 seconds, and Sponza from five hours down to 8 seconds. It might be possible to make it even faster, but I
did not quite go there.

Now, **your task is to make it run as fast as you can**. I'm not asking for a "hundred times", but something like
"**at least ten times faster**" is what you should aim for.

It's entirely your choice how you will do it. Better algorithms? More efficient math? Better data layout? Multi-threading? SIMD?
Rewrite in assembly? Rewrite as a compute shader / CUDA / OpenCL? Rewrite for NVIDIA RTX? All of these? You pick :) Some of what I listed
here is "certainly overkill" and not needed; achieving a 10x faster performance is entirely possible using relatively simple means.

Go!

#### What I will be looking at

* Overall I would recommend making a clone of this project on github and using "actual version control" workflow to make your changes.
If you don't like git or version control, that's fine; I can accept submissions in zip or dropbox or google drive (or whatever) form.
As long as I can see the code and try it out.
* Your optimized program should produce same looking images as the original one, just *do it faster*.
* I'll be looking at "everything" that is important in programming job: whether the code works correctly, is understandable,
  how is it structured, how it behaves performance wise (computing usage, memory usage etc.).
* It is *very* likely that your first submission will not be quite good, so do not delay it until the last day! Usually it
  takes 2-4 iterations to arrive at a good solution.



## About the code

I made it work on Windows (Visual Studio 2017) and Mac (Xcode 10); the project files for them are respectively in
`projects/VisualStudio/TrimeshTracer.sln` and `projects/Xcode/TrimeshTracer.xcodeproj`. In Visual Studio project, you might need to update settings to whatever Windows SDK version you have, I picked the oldest I had on my machine. If you have any trouble building or running it,
ask me!

The application accepts four command line arguments as input: `<width> <height> <spp> <datafile>`:

* `width` is image width in pixels,
* `height` is image height in pixels,
* `spp` is "samples per pixel"; kind of like "anti-aliasing level",
* `datafile` is path to a mesh to render; in Wavefront .OBJ format.

I added some example meshes under `data/` folder; initially I suggest starting with e.g. `data/cube.obj` which is just a simple
cube. I do *not* recommend trying to run the non-optimized version of the program on for example the Sponza model - it contains 66k
triangles and will run *very very slow*.

The code itself is fairly simple C++ code, and I tried to comment it extensively. No previous experience with ray-tracers
or path-tracers should be required.

If you *do* want to read up on what this "path tracing" thing is *(and maybe even get some ideas how to make it faster? who knows)*,
I can recommend "Ray Tracing in a Weekend", "Ray Tracing: The Next Week" and "Ray Tracing: the Rest of Your Life" minibook series,
which have been recently [made free here](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/). The internet is full of other information about ray/path tracing as well.

For reference, here are the performance numbers I get on my laptop (2019 MacBookPro i9 2.9GHz), rendering at 640x360, 4 samples per pixel, on this un-optimized implementation:

* cube.obj (14 triangles): 3818.3 KRay/s (0.6 sec)
* suzanne.obj (970 triangles): 48.3 KRays/s (53.0 sec)
* teapot.obj (15706 triangles): 3.5 KRays/s (683.0 sec)
* sponza.obj (66452 triangles): LOL nope, ain't nobody got time for that
